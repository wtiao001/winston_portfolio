                <h4>Appellate court bail ruling prompts more pretrial releases, but only in some cases</h4>
                <p>Superior courts across the state are holding what have become known as Humphrey hearings to determine a defendant’s financial status and consider bail alternatives in the wake of a 1st District Court of Appeal decision published in February.</p>
                <p>A San Francisco County judge released the man, Kenneth Humphrey, whose appeal was granted last week, but the appellate opinion has had varied results across the state. <span class="ital">In re Humphrey (2018)</span> 19 Cal. App. 5th 1006.</p>
                <p>The impact of the Humphrey hearings largely depend on the district attorney's opposition to pretrial release and the judge's discretion when considering a defendant's flight risk and threat to public safety, according to public defenders.</p>
                <p>"We've seen some district attorneys follow Humphrey and are agreeing to release plans which are less restrictive and more reasonable alternatives to bail and certainly we're seeing some district attorneys recognize that," said San Francisco County Public Defender Jeff Adachi. "But we've seen others who have taken the tack that many defendants should be detained without bail."</p>
                <p>San Francisco County prosecutors have started to advocate solely for no bail orders when it believes the defendant is a public safety threat or conditional release when it does not believe so, according to San Francisco district attorney's office spokesperson Max Szabo. Monetary bail is only imposed when the defendant poses a flight risk, he added.</p>
                <p>"The Humphrey decision came out which [said] that bail should only be set beyond what the defendant can reasonably afford to pay if the court articulates the fact that the individual is either likely to not come back to court and if there are no less restrictive means to ensure that the individual comes back for their court date," Szabo said.</p>
                <p>Sonoma County Public Defender Kathleen Pozzi also said the Humphrey decision has had the effect of judges imposing "no bail more often than they ever did before."</p>
                <p>"We have the same number of pretrial misdemeanor clients in jail as we did before Humphrey," Pozzi said. "This is very disheartening."</p>
                <p>The shift in the office's approach to pretrial release has led to a signficant increase in the number of defendants released prior to trial. In February and March 2017, 1,051 defendants were out on conditional release, according to San Francisco Sheriff Vicki Hennessy.</p>
                <p>That figure jumped to 1,616, nearly a 50 percent increase, in February and March this year, while the number of total bookings remained relatively similar from the same period last year.</p>
                <p>The number of defendants released on the highest level of supervision went up more than 30 percent in March, Hennessy added. She attributed this to the increase in defendants released after felony arrests for crimes such as second degree burglary, child pornography and battery of a peace officer.</p>
                <p>But Adachi said the district attorney's change in its approach fails to address what he said is the constitutional right to pretrial release.</p>
                <p>"We've seen some district attorneys follow Humphrey and are agreeing to release plans which are less restrictive and more reasonable alternatives to bail and certainly we're seeing some district attorneys recognize that," said San Francisco County Public Defender Jeff Adachi. "But we've seen others who have taken the tack that many defendants should be detained without bail."</p>
                <p>More defendants are being held on no bail orders despite more individuals being released prior to trial, Adachi said.</p>
                <p>"By taking that position, the district attorney's office, in my opinion, is working to defeat bail reform," he added.</p>
                <p>In Santa Clara County, Deputy Public Defender Avi Singh said arraignment attorneys come prepared with information about their client's ability to pay, ties to the community and programs appropriate to help their client in a "Humphrey-tailored request at the beginning of the arraignment."</p>
                <p>But Santa Clara County prosecutors have not changed their approach to bail and "haven't meaningfully engaged about what kind of pretrial release conditions fit each person's case," he added.</p>
                <p>Although Singh acknowledged more defendants are being let go on conditional release or on their own recognizance, the response has largely depended on the judge hearing the arraignment. Some judges are skeptical about evidence presented by public defenders concerning their clients' ability to pay and set bail as they did before Humphrey.</p>
                <p>In Santa Clara County, there has been a 10 percent increase in defendants assigned to the supervised or own-recognizance release programs, according to Director of Pretrial Services Aaron Johnson.</p>
                <p>The Los Angeles County Superior Court bench's application of Humphrey has been mixed, according to Interim Public Defender Nicole Davis Tinkham.</p>
                <p>"Some courts have embraced the individualized bail assessment mandated by Humphrey and are setting money bail only where no alternative exists, while others continue to condition release on the payment of huge amounts of money without regard for a defendant's particular circumstances," she said.</p>
                <p>Although they do not contest bail in specific cases, Los Angeles County public defenders actively monitor bail and seek higher court review when appropriate. But because these motions take time, "many clients held on excessive bail in minor cases plead guilty in order to get out which, ironically, prevents us from seeking review of the court's erroneous bail order in the first place," Tinkham added.</p>

                <h4>SF public defender’s bail challenges meeting resistance</h4>
                <p>SAN FRANCISCO — The aggressive plan of San Francisco Public Defender Jeff Adachi to challenge bail in every criminal filing backfired Friday when a judge responded by increasing a defendant’s bail by $20,000.</p>
                <p>Superior Court Judge Gerardo Sandoval made the decision following a testy exchange with Deputy Public Defender Crystal Carpino, who said her client’s bail was “unconstitutional and improper” because it failed to take his financial circumstances under consideration. She asked that the defendant be released on his own recognizance.</p>
                <p>The judge agreed with prosecutor Tom Cullinan, who described defendant Amie Mangisel as “a danger to the community” based on a charge that he made a criminal threat and exhibited a deadly weapon while threatening to kill another person.</p>
                <p>"We've seen some district attorneys follow Humphrey and are agreeing to release plans which are less restrictive and more reasonable alternatives to bail and certainly we're seeing some district attorneys recognize that," said San Francisco County Public Defender Jeff Adachi. "But we've seen others who have taken the tack that many defendants should be detained without bail."</p>
                <p>“Bail should have been set even higher as he is a threat to public safety,” Sandoval said. The judge then raised it from $15,000 to $35,000. People v. Mangisel, 17015365 (S.F. Super. Ct., led Oct. 19, 2017).</p>
                <p>Two reporters watched arrangments in different courtrooms on Friday morning. During that time, no judge released a jailed defendant or adopted a different system to evaluate them in response to Adachi’s blanket policy to challenge bail, which he started Oct. 10.</p>
                <p>Adachi said he was prompted by state Attorney General Xavier Becerra’s refusal to defend the system earlier this month in the 1st District Court of Appeal. In re: Kenneth Humphrey, A152056 (Cal. App. 1st Dist., led Aug. 4, 2017. He also cited a report released Tuesday by a group established by Chief Justice Tani Cantil-Sakauye, which called for the replacement of money bail.</p>
                <p>Told of what transpired in court Friday morning, Adachi said: “To hear that makes me wonder how many of these judges have read the report.</p>
                <p>“Bail is not supposed to be used as punishment. It’s not about trying to keep people in jail. It shows how far we have to go.”</p>
                <p>Friday’s result couldn’t have been a surprise to the public defender. Last week, he said his efforts to lower or reduce bail in all criminal complaints had encountered resistance from judges.</p>
                <p>Back in Sandoval’s courtroom, Carpino withdrew her motion to challenge bail for her next client after seeing what happened to Mangisel. Outside the courtroom she said she feared Sandoval would increase bail on that client, Marc Weiss, too. Weiss’ bail was $30,000 for a domestic violence charge.</p>
                <p>“The courts are always saying it’s a public safety risk but if that’s all it was, then why did the person even have a chance to get out,” Carpino said. “If it were me, I’d be out in 5 seconds because I can pay the bail, so it’s really not really about community safety.”</p>
                <p>In a third case before Sandoval, the defendant was released from jail after bail was posted.</p>
                <p>In another courtroom, Judge Tracy Brown denied Deputy Public Defender Everett Hewlett’s bid to change a no-bail ruling for his client, Eric Hernandez.</p>

                <h4>State appellate court employees renew push for haraassment policy</h4>
                <p>Supporters of a petition circulating around the Court of Appeal are trying to breathe new life into an initiative calling for increased transparency when reporting allegations of sexual harassment.</p>
                <p>In the wake of sexual harassment claims against two appellate justices, court employees are reviving a campaign to revise policies for the reporting and adjudication of complaints.</p>
                <p>The employees, mostly staff attorneys, say the mechanism for handling harassment allegations is murky when it involves a judge.</p>
                <p>"In light of current events, in the context of what's been going on with the #MeToo movement and certain stories we've heard in the Legislature, it just seems like the more open we are and the more people feel comfortable raising things, the better,"</p>
                <p>said Lyn Hinegardner, an attorney for the 1st District. "It's something that's worth looking at and re-evaluating."</p>
                <p>Justices Jim Humes and Sandra Margulies of the 1st District Court of Appeal and Luis Lavin and Thomas Willhite Jr. of the 2nd District breathed new life into a petition calling for increased transparency and accountability when reporting allegations of sexual harassment when they signed this week.</p>
                <p>One hundred and twenty seven appellate court employees have now signed. The petition is here (https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/8lnlkvm).</p>
                <p>Marguiles declined to comment. Lavin and Willhite could not be reached Thursday.</p>
                <p>A majority of signatories come from the 2nd District, where a state highway patrol officer alleged in July that Justice Jeffrey Johnson had sexually harassed her for years. He continues to work at the court.</p>
                <p>"I signed the petition because I believe it is good policy to establish clear sexual harassment policies based on research (best practices) and factual data (a survey and review of past incidents)," wrote Rita Himes, an attorney for the 1st District, in an email. "I believe the court should be proactive on the issue, and I wanted to support colleagues for whom this appears to be a salient concern."</p>
                <p>Employees from the 2nd District who signed the petition and were interviewed this week said they were not willing to be identi ed by name in this article.</p>
                <p>An attorney for the Court of Appeal who is among the leaders advocating for the petition and also declined to be identi ed said, "Clearly, the court's policies have failed to protect its employees, and reform is needed."</p>
                <p>Employees do not know where to submit complaints and do not have con dence they will be addressed appropriately or in a timely manner, according to another 2nd District attorney who signed the petition. "It doesn't feel particularly safe to report it here," she said.</p>
                <p>Employees receive sexual harassment training, but it is geared toward preventing misconduct and does not discuss what to do when it occurs, especially by justices.</p>
                <p>"Training is so geared toward employee-to-employee sexual harassment, which is very different than a justice who is the one engaging in inappropriate conduct," said the female 2nd District attorney.</p>
                <p>The working group needs to establish a centralized body to submit complaints that does not "serve at the pleasure of the justices, so that you can have con dence" in the reporting process, she added.</p>
                <p>Current policy directs employees to report complaints of misconduct to supervisors, human resource of cers or the administrative presiding justice -- all of whom have discretion about how to respond. The petition seeks the creation of an independent, centralized body that would revise procedures and policies for addressing and investigating claims at every district.</p>
                <p>The working group would be composed of judges, research attorneys and court employees, unlike its federal counterpart -- which is composed solely of judges.</p>
                <p>The matter is still under review by the Judicial Council, according to spokesman Peter Allen.</p>
                <p>Federal courts revised the judicial con dentiality policy and created a 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals director of workplace environment, who can counsel judges and employees confidentially on harassment and discrimination issues, in July in response to the December retirement of 9th Circuit Judge Alex Kozinski following accusations of misconduct.</p>
                <p>The petition referenced the retirement of 6th District Court of Appeal Presiding Justice Conrad Rushing as an example of when the court's existing sexual harassment policy failed.</p>
                <p>Rushing, like Kozinski, retired in December after allegations of sexual harassment and discrimination were investigated by an outside law rm. But the justice continued to serve for six months before stepping down.</p>
                <p>Another Court of Appeal attorney who initially supported the petition when it was presented at a judicial attorneys' conference in April said she has been thinking of removing her signature. The petition was initially a "general plan," which called for increased transparency in the reporting process, but has progressed to include speci c provisions.</p>
                <p>"I generally support the idea that these kinds of allegations should be reviewed and should be treated seriously and the process should be relatively transparent," she said. "I've just been really surprised at the coverage this has gotten since then that it's become this controversial thing."</p>
                <p>Two other attorneys for the Court of Appeal, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said the petition was never meant as a panacea and that it was a simply a vehicle for recognizing there is an issue that must be addressed.</p>
                <p>"What we purport to know is that the current system does not work and that there needs to be input by employees rather than have it done simply by the justices or, frankly, people at the [Judicial Council] who don't live in the same situation we live in," one said.</p>

                <h4>Few options for addressing judicial harassment</h4>
                <p>It took six months last year for Justice Conrad Rushing to leave the 6th District Court of Appeal in San Jose after an initial review into allegations he had harassed employees and engaged in other workplace misconduct.</p>
                <p>The court has not disclosed when the alleged misconduct was rst disclosed but Rushing&rsquo;s case points to a problem facing courts dealing with accusations of harassment: Judges aren&rsquo;t employees who can be summarily placed on administrative leave while allegations against them are investigated.</p>
                <p>They are constitutional of cers with great authority to determine how allegations against them are investigated, at least in the initial stage.</p>
                <p>With allegations of misconduct facing 2nd District Court of Appeal Justice Jeffrey Johnson, the court now faces a similar problem.</p>
                <p>A California Highway Patrol of cer assigned to drive Johnson to of cial functions told investigators the justice repeatedly made lewd comments and requested sex, prompting her to seek a transfer to another division of the CHP. A summary of the allegations reviewed by the Daily Journal appeared to suggest other women have accused Johnson.</p>
                <p>The court has no authority to take action against Johnson, even if of cials believe the allegations have merit.</p>
                <p>Johnson, based in Los Angeles, is still on the bench. Calls to the court and to Johnson seeking comment for this article were not returned.</p>
                <p>Judicial of cers cannot be suspended from of ce, even temporarily, until the Commission on Judicial Performance &mdash; the independent agency with the authority to discipline judges &mdash; completes its investigation and les formal charges.</p>
                <p>&ldquo;Only the Commission on Judicial Performance has the authority to discipline a judge,&rdquo; said Judicial Council senior attorney Mark Jacobson. &ldquo;If there&rsquo;s a complaint against a judge, the court needs to look into it, but they can&rsquo;t do anything about the judge.&rdquo;</p>
                <p>The standards are set out in the Rule 120 (b) of the Commission on Judicial Performance.</p>
                <p>&ldquo;Before the commission has reached a determination regarding removal or retirement of a judge, the commission may temporarily disqualify a judge without loss of salary upon notice of formal proceedings pursuant to article VI, section 18(b) of the California Constitution if the commission determines that the continued service of the judge is causing immediate, irreparable, and continuing public harm,&rdquo; the rule states.</p>
                <p>&ldquo;The utility of the provision would be for when there&rsquo;s clear potential for ongoing harm to public protection,&rdquo; said Commission on Judicial Performance Director-Chief Counsel Gregory Dresser. &ldquo;In circumstances where it would be appropriate, you would want the ability to do that.&rdquo;</p>
                <p>But Dresser could only cite a single example of the provision being utilized, two decades ago.</p>
                <p>In 1998, former Ventura County Superior Court Judge Robert C. Bradley was suspended by the CJP after he was arrested for driving under the in uence multiple times, according to Dresser.</p>
                <p>Dresser said there may be a more recent use of the provision but he couldn&rsquo;t recall it.</p>
                <p>The commission noti ed Bradley of formal proceedings against him in March 1998 and the following month &ldquo;issued an order of disquali cation barring Judge Bradley from acting as a judge pending further order of the commission or until the completion of formal proceedings,&rdquo; according to commission records.</p>
                <p>If the CJP doesn&rsquo;t le charges, a judge can continue to go to work.</p>
                <p>That&rsquo;s what happened in the case of Rushing, the longtime presiding justice of the 6th District in San Jose. Of cials with the appellate court contacted the Judicial Council, which helped to hire Sacramento law rm Ellis Buehler Makus to investigate the allegations. According to the San Jose Mercury News, the report was completed in May 2017 and forwarded to the CJP.</p>
                <p>In the meantime, Rushing continued to serve as a justice. The commission never led charges against him, and he quietly resigned in October 2017, with an effective date of Dec. 4.</p>
                <p>The 6th District did not respond to a query on whether the court accommodated complainants, who included employees in his courtroom, before Rushing resigned. Ellis Buehler Makus did not return a phone call seeking comment.</p>
                <p>Dresser could not con rm whether Rushing was investigated. He also declined to comment on whether Johnson is being investigated.</p>
                <p>No judicial branch agency, including the commission, has authority to mandate workplace accommodations, such as counseling or reassignment, to address allegations of misconduct against judicial of cers, according to Dresser.</p>
                <p>The commission can only impose one of ve disciplinary measures &mdash; removal from of ce, public censure, public admonishment, private admonishment or an advisory letter &mdash; and only after a formal investigation is completed.</p>
                <p>No discipline can be imposed outside of those actions, and the commission is not empowered to force a judicial of cer to take any action to accommodate complainants or witnesses, according to Dresser.</p>
                <p>&ldquo;No, they can&rsquo;t force them to do anything,&rdquo; Dresser said.</p>
                <p>The council declined to comment on whether it facilitated nding a rm to investigate allegations against Johnson.</p>
                <p>An individual with a complaint of misconduct against a judicial of cer can take it to the commission or the court&rsquo;s presiding judicial of cer, according to Dresser.</p>
                <p>The presiding judicial of cer who is noti ed of a claim of misconduct against a judge, justice, or commissioner will typically conduct an investigation to determine the validity of the complaint before referring it to the commission, he said.</p>
                <p>California Rules of Court 10.603 mandates presiding judicial of cers notify the commission of &ldquo;a judge&rsquo;s substantial failure to perform judicial duties...,&rdquo; which Dresser said includes allegations of sexual harassment.</p>
                <p>&ldquo;Whenever a judge has reliable information that another judge has violated any provision of the Code of Judicial Ethics, that judge shall take appropriate corrective action, which may include reporting the violation to the appropriate authority,&rdquo; state Supreme Court spokesperson Cathal Conneely Conneely wrote in an email.</p>

                <h4>Persky recall may already be having an impact on other judges, lawyers say </h4>
                <p><div class="content-img-wrap">

                </div><p>The campaign to recall Santa Clara County Superior Court Judge Aaron Persky may encourage judges to impose harsher sentences rather than offer alternative rehabilitation options, according to some legal experts who expressed concerns that a successful recall will affect judicial independence. Others disagree.</p>
                <p>"There's going to be a pressure on judges to be harsh rather than perhaps deciding the case on the facts of the law," said McManis Faulkner attorney Jim McManis, who said he is Persky's lawyer. "It's easier to throw the book at defendants than take a chance and give them probation."</p>
                <p>The leader of the recall effort -- Michele Dauber, a professor at Stanford Law School - - dismissed those concerns as overblown fears that do not give judges enough credit when making sentencing decisions.</p>
                <p>"Judges are capable enough to tell the difference between privileged, highs-status, elite offenders convicted of sex crimes and poor, low-status offenders," Dauber said.</p>
                <p>The recall campaign started after Persky sentenced Brock Turner, a former Stanford University student, to six months in jail for sexual assault on an unconscious woman. He served three months and he is appealing his conviction. People v. Turner, H043709 (Santa Clara Super. Ct., led June 2, 2016).</p>
                <p>If a majority of voters cast ballots to recall Persky, he would be replaced by one of two candidates seeking his seat: Assistant District Attorney Cindy Hendrickson or civil attorney Angela Storey.</p>
                <p>A Santa Clara County judge has already been in uenced by the recall efforts, according to Santa Clara County Bar Association President Chris Burdick.</p>
                <p>Santa Clara County Superior Court Judge Vincent J. Chiarello declined to approve a deal he helped facilitate in a case involving a defendant, Sean Ryan, who was charged with three felony counts of lewd and lascivious acts with a minor and would require him to register as a sex offender if convicted. People v. Ryan, B1685649 (Santa Clara Super. Ct., led April 15, 2016).</p>
                <p>After a defense expert concluded Ryan did not present a public safety threat, Chiarello and the prosecution agreed to reduce the charges to felony unlawful sexual intercourse, which does not require sex registration, in addition to having him serve a year in jail. But after the victim unexpectedly appeared at the sentencing hearing to give an impact statement, Chiarello decided to pull the plug on the deal and send Ryan to state prison.</p>
                <p>The judge said he agreed with the victim that Ryan continued to present a public safety threat, according to court transcripts.</p>
                <p>Chiarello's decision came three days after Dauber announced she planned to put her campaign to remove and replace Persky from the bench on the June ballot.</p>
                <p>Defense attorney Philip Schnayerson, who represented Ryan, said his client was "Turner-ed," a term they created to describe a judge imposing a harsher sentence on a defendant to avoid public scrutiny.</p>
                <p>Persky portrayed himself as a symbol of the threat to judicial independence at a press conference earlier this month, warning that politics will inevitably creep into the courtroom because judges will start to consider the public's opinion of their sentencing decisions due to the recall campaign.</p>
                <p>"Judges will feel that silent, creeping, corrupting force of what happens if I decide X," Persky said. "That's not what judges should be thinking about."</p>
                <p>Santa Clara County Deputy Public Defender Avi Singh said the sentence Persky imposed "is exactly what I would want for a ... client of mine under similar circumstances," explaining that the judge properly utilized his discretion to give Turner a chance at rehabilitation and said that mass incarceration is a result of judges who do not utilize this discretion.</p>
                <p>"The punishment or removal of Judge Persky in response to his exercise of discretion could lead to policies that limit that discretion, will deter other judges from extending mercy and instead encourage them to issue unfairly harsh sentences for fear of reprisal," Singh added.</p>
                <p>Dauber said recall opponents "have a very dim view of judicial integrity," adding that judges should not fear future recall efforts because the standard for getting one on the ballot is extremely high because of the number of signatures, money and mobilization it requires.</p>
                <p>Persky also said he does not expect a spate of judicial recalls even if his is successful. The effect will be "more subtle and insidious," he warned, taking the form of litigants questioning if judges assigned to them can make unpopular decisions that may put their reputations and careers at stake.</p>
                <p>The state Legislature passed two bills in 2016 in response to the outcry over Turner's sentencing. Two of the crimes Turner was convicted of now carry a mandatory three- year prison sentence, which Santa Clara School of Law professor Ellen Kreitzberg said makes the recall effort unnecessary because it ensures a higher threshold of accountability for sexual assault crimes.</p>
                <p>But Dauber, who said she was not in support of the new mandatory minimum, said the state Legislature's response to Persky's abuse of discretion is even more of a reason to remove him from the bench.</p>
                <p>"It's terrible the Legislature has taken away judicial discretion from 1,500 judges in order to deal with the problem of the one judge who did" abuse discretion, Dauber said. "Our solution is to remove the bad judge, not tie the hands of the good ones."</p>

                <h4>Persky recall stirs angry debate about judicial independence</h4>
                <p>

                    <div class="img-caption">Michele Dauber, a professor at Stanford Law School who is behind the recall campaign of Santa Clara County Judge Aaron Persky, says California judges are not, in fact, fully independent and infrequent recalls are not harmful.</div>
                </div>
                <p>Two sides that typically consider themselves progressives find each other on opposite sides on the issue of judicial independence in the wake of a recall campaign for Santa Clara Superior Court judge Aaron Persky.</p>
                <p>Proponents of the recall argue it is necessary to balance judicial independence and accountability. They claim Persky demonstrated a history of bias in favor of men charged with sexual crimes and violence against women.</p>
                <p>&ldquo;This is a feature, not a bug, of our system,&rdquo; said recall campaign organizer and Stanford Law School professor Michele Dauber. &ldquo;Any system of judicial selection is balancing competing value sets of independence and accountability and democratic legitimacy.&rdquo;</p>
                <p>Recall opponents said the campaign to oust Persky is an attack on the judiciary&rsquo;s independence and that this tactic has been and will increasingly be used to unseat judges who issue unpopular decisions.</p>
                <p>They maintain recall proponents have cherry-picked cases that Persky presided over to criticize how women&rsquo;s rights are being addressed in the court system nationally.</p>
                <p>&ldquo;What we&rsquo;re going to end up with is judges looking over their shoulders and putting their nger to the wind to assess what they should do,&rdquo; said former Santa Clara County Superior Court judge LaDoris Cordell. &ldquo;That is not an independent judiciary.&rdquo;</p>
                <p>Both sides accused the other of mispresenting facts in the trial of former Stanford University swimmer Brock Turner, who served three months in county jail after he was found guilty on three counts of assault with intent to commit rape of an intoxicated or unconscious person, sexual penetration of an intoxicated person and sexual penetration of an unconscious person.</p>
                <p>Persky&rsquo;s defenders contended recall organizers have unjusti ably attempted to frame the Turner trial as a snapshot of a larger pattern of bias toward similarly high-status, male offenders, while recall proponents say the opposition is downplaying Persky&rsquo;s use of judicial discretion in his sentencing decision.</p>
                <p>Santa Clara County Bar Association Chief Executive Of cer Chris Burdick said the bar&rsquo;s board came together to assess Persky&rsquo;s sentencing history in similar cases and concluded the recall campaign was citing trials in which plea deals were entered, and therefore don&rsquo;t re ect Persky&rsquo;s alleged leniency and use of discretion.</p>
                <p>The Commission on Judicial Performance also conducted a similar investigation and came to the conclusion that Persky had not exhibited bias in any of his past cases.</p>
                <p>Dauber said the commission&rsquo;s inquiry contained &ldquo;serious factual errors that make it impossible to rely on.&rdquo;</p>
                <p>McManis Faulkner attorney Elizabeth Pipkin, a lawyer for Persky, said the public&rsquo;s anger is misdirected because Persky&rsquo;s decision was within the recommendations made by the female probation of cer&rsquo;s report.</p>
                <p>She recommended a county jail sentence, which carries a maximum of one year, for an unspeci ed amount of time in addition to probation for three years, while the district attorney&rsquo;s of ce wanted Turner to serve six years in state prison.</p>
                <p>&ldquo;To the extent that people feel the sentence was lenient, part of that is what the law allows in these cases, and the law hasn&rsquo;t been changed nationally,&rdquo; Pipkin said. &ldquo;The focus should be changing the law instead of replacing judges following it.&rdquo;</p>
                <p>In response to the public outcry concerning Turner&rsquo;s sentencing, Gov. Jerry Brown signed two sexual assault bills in 2016, barring judges from granting probation to defendants convicted of assaulting unconscious victims.</p>
                <p>Under the new laws, two of the crimes Turner was convicted of would carry a mandatory three-year prison sentence, while probation would only be granted to someone convicted of the third crime Turner was convicted of, intent to commit rape, for cases with &ldquo;unusual circumstances,&rdquo; which Persky cited in the Turner trial.</p>
                <p>Cordell said this is most likely the rst of many recall campaigns to come. She added that the tactic has set a precedent that a community has the power to unseat a judge if he or she issues opinions they do not agree with. &ldquo;If this recall succeeds, judges will know that you can make one controversial or unpopular decision, but what you believe is right, and still get booted,&rdquo; Cordell said. &ldquo;They won&rsquo;t be willing to be lenient, out of fear that they&rsquo;re up next.&rdquo;</p>
                <p>Shesaid she was alarmed when she realized that four deputy public defenders were challenging four incumbent San Francisco County Superior Court judges because they were appointed by Republican governors. She said the jduges have an excellent track record.</p>
                <p>Prominent plaintiff&rsquo;s attorney John Keker said the injection of partisan politics into state judicial elections has already had a chilling effect on the judiciary and that the deputy public defenders&rsquo; challenging the judges because of the governors&rsquo; political party is &ldquo;disturbing.&rdquo;</p>
                <p>&ldquo;These public defenders have a right to run against the incumbents, but just because you have a right, doesn&rsquo;t mean it&rsquo;s defensible or a good thing,&rdquo; Keker said.</p>
                <p>Dauber said she doesn&rsquo;t want to con ate the recall efforts to the contested judicial elections in San Francisco.</p>
                <p>&ldquo;Because we have this system that is balancing these competing value sets and because recall is used so infrequently, this would not reduce judicial independence,&rdquo; Dauber said. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe there&rsquo;s any impact to it. State judges in California are not fully independent.&rdquo;</p>
                <p>Keker, who expressed no opinion on Persky&rsquo;s abilities as a judge, said, &ldquo;I think it&rsquo;s terrible that he is being attacked in the way he has, especially by a Stanford law professor. ...&rdquo;</p>

                <h4>Persky, facing recall, said his ouster would endanger judicial independence</h4>
                <p><div class="content-img-wrap">

                    <div class="img-caption">Santa Clara County Superior Court Judge Aaron Persky said a successful recall of him would endanger judicial independence by forcing other judges to deal with a "silent creeping, corrupting force" of public pressure.</div>
                </div><p>Speaking out publicly for the rst time, Santa Clara County Superior Court Judge Aaron Persky argued Tuesday the judiciary&rsquo;s independence will be undermined if the campaign to recall him is successful.</p>
                <p>Persky, whose six-month sentence of a Stanford University swimmer for sexual assault on an unconscious woman prompted a recall campaign, said such efforts should be reserved for misconduct or incompetence and not to unseat judges who make unpopular&nbsp;decisions.</p>
                <p>During a press conference at a private residence that organizers asked not to be disclosed, Persky focused less on defending his sentencing decision in the Brock Turner case than in casting himself as a symbol of endangered judicial independence.</p>
                <p>&ldquo;Our system of government cannot function the way our nation&rsquo;s founders intended if the courts are reduced to being political weather vanes,&rdquo; Persky said. &ldquo;When a group threatens to recall one judge because they disagree with a ruling, they threaten all judges. They threaten the independence of the judiciary.&rdquo;</p>
                <p>Politics will creep into the courtroom because judges will start to consider the public&rsquo;s opinion of their sentencing decisions in the wake of the recall campaign, Persky warned. He added the winds can easily shift and that a conservative county can use this tactic to unseat progressive judges over an unpopular decision there.</p>
                <p>When asked if community values should play any part in a judge&rsquo;s sentencing consideration, Persky said the California Code of Judicial Ethics and the state Constitution instruct judges to do the exact opposite &mdash; to not let public opinion in uence their decisions.</p>
                <p>&ldquo;We can&rsquo;t do it ethically,&rdquo; Persky said. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s up to the Legislature to make laws, and it&rsquo;s up to judges to enforce those laws.&rdquo;</p>
                <p>The judge said he does not expect a spate of judicial recalls even if this one is successful. The effect will be &ldquo;more subtle and insidious,&rdquo; taking the form of litigants questioning if judges assigned to them can make unpopular decisions that may put their reputations and careers at stake, he added.</p>
                <p>&ldquo;Judges will feel that silent, creeping, corrupting force of what happens if I decide X,&rdquo; Persky said. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s not what judges should be thinking about.&rdquo;</p>
                <p>But recall campaign organizer and Stanford Law School professor Michele Dauber argued judicial recalls are an essential feature of the court system. Judges should be accountable to the voters in their counties because they are elected officials, she added.</p>
                <p>&ldquo;Persky has a long pattern of bias in favor privileged men who commit violence against women,&rdquo; Dauber said. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s repeatedly abused discretion and as a result, voters lost faith in his ability to be fair.&rdquo;</p>
                <p>Both sides have accused the other of misrepresenting facts in the case of Turner, who served three months in jail for assault with intent to commit rape of an intoxicated or unconscious person, sexual penetration of an intoxicated person and sexual penetration of an unconscious person.</p>
                <p>Recall opponents contended the opposition has unfairly attempted to frame Turner&rsquo;s sentencing as a larger pattern of bias toward similarly privileged, male offenders, while recall organizers argued that Persky&rsquo;s defenders have downplayed the judge&rsquo;s judicial discretion in the sentencing decision.</p>
                <p>The Commission on Judicial Performance and the Santa Clara County Bar Association concluded Persky did not display any pattern of bias.</p>
                <p>The state Legislature passed two bills in 2016 in response to the outcry over Turner&rsquo;s sentencing.Two of the crimes Turner was convicted of now carry a mandatory three- year prison sentence.</p>
                <p>Santa Clara County Assistant District Attorney Cindy Hendrickson and Angela Storey of Storey &amp; Storey will be on the June ballot, seeking Persky&rsquo;s seat if he is recalled.</p>

                <h4>County courts are defying Judicial Council rule on judicial officer settlements, critics say</h4>
                <p>A Judicial Council rule intended to require the revelation of the names of judges when settlements are reached is not being followed, attorneys said.</p>
                <p>SAN FRANCISCO &mdash; Last month, the Judicial Council passed an amendment requiring the disclosure of settlement agreements involving judges accused of sexual harassment and other misconduct. California Chief Justice Tani Cantil-Sakauyehad personally called for the change.</p>
                <p>But county courts have been inconsistent in applying the rule, which is supposed to apply to any settlement agreement dating back to Jan. 1, 2010. One county court revealed a $175,000 settlement but declined to name the accused individual.</p>
                <p>Alameda County Superior Court released a long list of judicial administrative records dating back to 2010, revealing a $175,000 settlement the court paid in 2017. But the name of the judicial officer or court employee is redacted, which several attorneys said is a violation of the amendment.</p>
                <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m having trouble seeing a good reason as to why it was redacted,&rdquo; said David Snyder of the First Amendment Coalition, which specializes in increasing government accountability and transparency. &ldquo;They redacted the name of the court employee respondent, and that should be disclosed, regardless of whether the individual was a judge or a clerk.&rdquo;</p>
                <p>Alameda County disclosed seven years worth of its judicial administrative records on an easily navigable website. But it redacted too much information, according to some attorneys.</p>
                <p>Snyder said Friday he suspected the respondent was a judge because of multiple references in the settlement agreement to the Judicial Council, which provides legal advice in complaints of misconduct against a judge.</p>
                <p>He also said California Rules of Court 10.500 could refer to non-judges because the Judicial Council also uses the term, &ldquo;subordinate judicial officers,&rdquo; which could include court staff.</p>
                <p>&ldquo;In context of the language, it makes it seem like judicial officers refer to staff,&rdquo; Snyder said.</p>
                <p>Mary-Alice Coleman, a labor attorney with the Law Of ce of Mary-Alice Coleman who is a member of the Consumer Attorneys of California, which is co-sponsoring a bill that would prevent individuals and businesses from entering into secret settlements in sexual harassment and discrimination cases, said the court violated the rule by redacting the names of judicial officers.</p>
                <p>&ldquo;What needs to be very clear, and I assume is the point, is that because it&rsquo;s a judicial officer who was named as a wrongdoer, they can&rsquo;t just redact that name,&rdquo; Coleman said. &ldquo;It says you can&rsquo;t redact the name of any judicial officer anyway, regardless of whether he&rsquo;s a respondent or complainant.&rdquo;</p>
                <p>In response to a Daily Journal request under the California Public Records Act, Alameda County Superior Court Executive Officer Chad Finke declined to say if any of the settlements involved a judge accused of misconduct.</p>
                <p>&ldquo;Under rule 10.500, we are obligated to produce responsive judicial administrative records,&rdquo; Finke said in a statement Friday. &ldquo;Here we have produced all records that we have that are responsive to your May 31, 2018, request. I believe that ful lls our responsibility under the amended rule.&rdquo;</p>
                <p>Other counties have also set up roadblocks to obtaining judicial administrative records.</p>
                <p>The Los Angeles and San Diego county superior courts require public records requests to be mailed or hand-delivered. The Los Angeles court also requests advance payment for the cost of copying records and labor, which Judicial Council spokesman Peter Allen said it should not be doing.</p>
                <p>&ldquo;The irony is there are so few judges that have been subjected to this, that by resisting it, it makes it worse,&rdquo; Allen said. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s like, &lsquo;Oh, they must be hiding something.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
                <p>The mechanisms for the disclosure of these records were largely left to the individual courts, according to 4th District Court of Appeal Justice Marsha G. Slough, who chaired the group that pioneered the expedited revision at Cantil-Sakauye&rsquo;s request.</p>
                <p>Putting each county court&rsquo;s records concerning judicial officers who have resolved complaints of misconduct on a centralized location managed by the council was not discussed because it has &ldquo;very little direct control, so to speak, over the 58 independent superior court systems,&rdquo; according to Slough.</p>
                <p>&ldquo;I think all that the Judicial Council can do is direct the trial court to follow the rules of court,&rdquo; Slough said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not an expert, but my general thought is that no, we could not ask, because the council is the policymaking body of the judicial branch.&rdquo;</p>

                <h4>Courts’ revelations of misconduct settlements leave many unanswered questions</h4>
                <p>State courts have paid over $1.1 million since 2010 to settle claims of sexual harassment and discrimination against judicial officers and court employees, according to judicial administrative records obtained by the Daily Journal.</p>
                <p>The courts that paid settlements include those in Alameda, Tulare, El Dorado, Lassen, San Bernardino, Alpine, Tehama, Santa Clara and Los Angeles counties. Several of the settlements involve court employees and not judicial officers. The names of individuals who were accused of wrongdoing are not included in the settlement agreements, with a single exception.</p>
                <p>The names of the judges and the nature of the claims of misconduct also remain unknown in most agreements. The records provided by the Judicial Council and the state courts were heavily redacted.</p>
                <p>The Judicial Council &mdash; at the direction of Chief Justice Tani Cantil-Sakauye &mdash; amended the California Rules of Court 10.500 in June to provide public access to judicial administrative records concerning judicial officers who have resolved complaints of settlements &ldquo;for which public funds were spent in payment of the settlement, including any settlement agreement[s] arising from claims or complaints of sexual harassment or sexual discrimination.&rdquo;</p>
                <p>&ldquo;In 2018, we need to rebalance the protections within the rule to ensure that they do not undermine public trust and con dence in the judicial branch or access to information about how taxpayer funds are being spent,&rdquo; Cantil-Sakauye said.</p>
                <p>Because California Public Records Act requests do not apply to the judicial branch, the Judicial Council adopted procedures concerning judicial administrative records in 2010 to &ldquo;provide public access to nondeliberative and nonadjudicative court records, budget and management information.&rdquo; The rule provided that judicial officers were exempt from being named in these records.</p>
                <p>The group assigned to revise the rule in April, headed by 4th District Court of Appeal Justice Marsha G. Slough, amended the exemption to ensure that the names of judicial officers were not exempt from being disclosed.</p>
                <p>But the records disclosed by the Judicial Council and several superior courts leave it unclear in what capacity multiple judicial officers named in the settlements are involved in the claims of misconduct, if at all.</p>
                <p>&ldquo;We note that it is common for settlement agreements to include the names of court executive officers and presiding and assistant presiding judges who sign the agreements on behalf of the court,&rdquo; a council spokesperson wrote in an email. &ldquo;The fact that a presiding or assistant presiding judge or court executive officer has signed an agreement on behalf of the court does not mean that he or she was named as a respondent or defendant in a claim or action.&rdquo;</p>
                <p>The counties that paid the most to settle claims include Alameda County Superior Court, which spent $201,000 to resolve two claims of misconduct, and Los Angeles County Superior Court, which spent $322,000 to resolve four claims of misconduct from 2010 to 2012. Santa Clara County also spent $150,000 to resolve a sexual harassment claim in 2013.</p>
                <p>The three courts&rsquo; responsive documents did not name any judicial officers.</p>
                <p>The majority of the settlement agreements also include confidentiality clauses, such as one with Santa Clara County Superior Court.</p>
                <p>&ldquo;The Parties covenant that neither they nor their agents will, without compulsion of legal process, reveal to any person or entity (except immediate family members, accountants, attorneys or other professional advisors to whom the disclosure is necessary to effect the purposes for which they have consulted such advisors), directly or indirectly, disclose any of the terms of this Agreement or the settlement sum paid to Employee, nor any of the claims or facts which led to the Dispute,&rdquo; according to a June 2013 settlement agreement for $150,000.</p>
                <p>In 2016, Tulare County Superior Court settled a sexual harassment claim against former Judge Valeriano Saucedo for $120,000.Lassen County Superior Court also settled a sex discrimination claim for $135,000 in February 2018, according to records provided by the council. A former judicial officer and former clerk were defendants in the agreement.</p>
                <p>The court did not immediately respond for comment.</p>
                <p>Tehama County Superior Court settled a sex discrimination claim for $150,000 in 2015. The claim was brought by a former court employee against the court &ldquo;asserting that her termination from employment was based on gender discrimination and harassment, and also in retaliation for her protected activities, including whistleblower complaints.&rdquo;</p>
                <p>San Bernardino County resolved a sex discrimination claim in 2016 for $25,000. Alpine County resolved a similar claim in 2012 for $2,500.</p>

                <h4>San Francisco public defender’s office challenges bail on 282 criminal cases</h4>
                <p>San Francisco Public Defender Jeff Adachi announced Wednesday that his office has led challenges to every criminal case in which bail was set since Oct. 10 in response to a California Attorney General Xavier Becerra’s refusal to defend the system in court earlier this month.</p>
                <p>SAN FRANCISCO &mdash; San Francisco has led challenges to every criminal case in which bail was set since Oct. 10, Public Defender Jeff Adachi said Wednesday. The move was in response to a California Attorney General Xavier Becerra&rsquo;s refusal earlier this month to defend the system in court.</p>
                <p>Adachi also cited a report released Tuesday by a group established by Chief Justice Tani G. Cantil-Sakauye calling for the replacement of money bail. Adachi said in an interview that his of ce has appealed bail on 282 cases and would continue the practice indefinitely.</p>
                <p>&ldquo;The California criminal justice system is addicted to bail, and it&rsquo;s going to be a challenging and difficult process to move the courts from the practice to a more enlightened approach,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;The purpose of bail isn&rsquo;t to keep someone locked up. It&rsquo;s supposed to consider a person&rsquo;s ability to pay and should primarily be based on whether they&rsquo;ll show up to court.&rdquo;</p>
                <p>Becerra refused to defend the bail system after Kenneth Humphrey, a 64-year-old retired shipyard worker, appealed his $350,000 bail. The man was charged with first- degree residential robbery, theft, and in icting injury on an elder and dependent adult.</p>
                <p>The public defender challenged the bail, and a 1st District Court of Appeal panel ordered the attorney general to explain why Humphrey should not be released.</p>
                <p>&ldquo;The Department of Justice has determined that it will not defend any application of the bail law that does not take into consideration a person&rsquo;s ability to pay, or alternative methods of ensuring a person&rsquo;s appearance at trial,&rdquo; Deputy Attorney General Katie L. Stowe wrote in the Oct. 2 ling. In re: Kenneth Humphrey, A152056 (Cal. App. 1st Dist., led Aug. 4, 2017).</p>
                <p>Adachi said he is trying to get judges to justify their rationale concerning high bail figures, especially when most of his clients have very little money and assets. Twenty percent of the appeals his office has led resulted in reduced bails or the defendant&rsquo;s release, he said.</p>
                <p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re not seeing judges shifting their thinking,&rdquo; Adachi said. &ldquo;The judges merely read from a script that says, &lsquo;We&rsquo;re considering the individual&rsquo;s circumstances.&rsquo; That way, they have something written out to make a record of it.&rdquo;</p>
                <p>The public defender has employed a bail unit, composed of two attorneys and three support staff, to le additional motions. Courts are obligated to rehear bail motions within ve days if requested. State Sen. Robert Hertzberg has authored a bill making changes in the bail system similar to the recommendations made by the report from the chief justice. The state Senate approved the bill but Hertzberg said he would need to make additional compromises to get the bill through the Assembly.</p>
                <p>Meanwhile, Adachi said he isn&rsquo;t waiting on the Legislature. He called on other public defenders to follow his lead.</p>
                <p>&ldquo;If this is something everyone does statewide, we can really begin moving the courts to adopt what the chief justice is saying needs to happen in terms of reform,&rdquo; Adachi said. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s going to be a battle between now and the time when there is legislation that passes.&rdquo;</p>

                <h4>Appellate court bail ruling prompts more pretrial releases, but only in some cases</h4>
                <p>Superior courts across the state are holding what have become known as Humphrey hearings to determine a defendant’s financial status and consider bail alternatives in the wake of a 1st District Court of Appeal decision published in February.</p>
                <p>A San Francisco County judge released the man, Kenneth Humphrey, whose appeal was granted last week, but the appellate opinion has had varied results across the state. <span class="ital">In re Humphrey (2018)</span> 19 Cal. App. 5th 1006.</p>
                <p>The impact of the Humphrey hearings largely depend on the district attorney's opposition to pretrial release and the judge's discretion when considering a defendant's flight risk and threat to public safety, according to public defenders.</p>
                <p>"We've seen some district attorneys follow Humphrey and are agreeing to release plans which are less restrictive and more reasonable alternatives to bail and certainly we're seeing some district attorneys recognize that," said San Francisco County Public Defender Jeff Adachi. "But we've seen others who have taken the tack that many defendants should be detained without bail."</p>
                <p>San Francisco County prosecutors have started to advocate solely for no bail orders when it believes the defendant is a public safety threat or conditional release when it does not believe so, according to San Francisco district attorney's office spokesperson Max Szabo. Monetary bail is only imposed when the defendant poses a flight risk, he added.</p>
                <p>"The Humphrey decision came out which [said] that bail should only be set beyond what the defendant can reasonably afford to pay if the court articulates the fact that the individual is either likely to not come back to court and if there are no less restrictive means to ensure that the individual comes back for their court date," Szabo said.</p>
                <p>Sonoma County Public Defender Kathleen Pozzi also said the Humphrey decision has had the effect of judges imposing "no bail more often than they ever did before."</p>
                <p>"We have the same number of pretrial misdemeanor clients in jail as we did before Humphrey," Pozzi said. "This is very disheartening."</p>
                <p>The shift in the office's approach to pretrial release has led to a signficant increase in the number of defendants released prior to trial. In February and March 2017, 1,051 defendants were out on conditional release, according to San Francisco Sheriff Vicki Hennessy.</p>
                <p>That figure jumped to 1,616, nearly a 50 percent increase, in February and March this year, while the number of total bookings remained relatively similar from the same period last year.</p>
                <p>The number of defendants released on the highest level of supervision went up more than 30 percent in March, Hennessy added. She attributed this to the increase in defendants released after felony arrests for crimes such as second degree burglary, child pornography and battery of a peace officer.</p>
                <p>But Adachi said the district attorney's change in its approach fails to address what he said is the constitutional right to pretrial release.</p>
                <p>"We've seen some district attorneys follow Humphrey and are agreeing to release plans which are less restrictive and more reasonable alternatives to bail and certainly we're seeing some district attorneys recognize that," said San Francisco County Public Defender Jeff Adachi. "But we've seen others who have taken the tack that many defendants should be detained without bail."</p>
                <p>More defendants are being held on no bail orders despite more individuals being released prior to trial, Adachi said.</p>
                <p>"By taking that position, the district attorney's office, in my opinion, is working to defeat bail reform," he added.</p>
                <p>In Santa Clara County, Deputy Public Defender Avi Singh said arraignment attorneys come prepared with information about their client's ability to pay, ties to the community and programs appropriate to help their client in a "Humphrey-tailored request at the beginning of the arraignment."</p>
                <p>But Santa Clara County prosecutors have not changed their approach to bail and "haven't meaningfully engaged about what kind of pretrial release conditions fit each person's case," he added.</p>
                <p>Although Singh acknowledged more defendants are being let go on conditional release or on their own recognizance, the response has largely depended on the judge hearing the arraignment. Some judges are skeptical about evidence presented by public defenders concerning their clients' ability to pay and set bail as they did before Humphrey.</p>
                <p>In Santa Clara County, there has been a 10 percent increase in defendants assigned to the supervised or own-recognizance release programs, according to Director of Pretrial Services Aaron Johnson.</p>
                <p>The Los Angeles County Superior Court bench's application of Humphrey has been mixed, according to Interim Public Defender Nicole Davis Tinkham.</p>
                <p>"Some courts have embraced the individualized bail assessment mandated by Humphrey and are setting money bail only where no alternative exists, while others continue to condition release on the payment of huge amounts of money without regard for a defendant's particular circumstances," she said.</p>
                <p>Although they do not contest bail in specific cases, Los Angeles County public defenders actively monitor bail and seek higher court review when appropriate. But because these motions take time, "many clients held on excessive bail in minor cases plead guilty in order to get out which, ironically, prevents us from seeking review of the court's erroneous bail order in the first place," Tinkham added.</p>
